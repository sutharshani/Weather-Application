## Introduction
For your class project we will be creating an application to interacts with a webservice in order to obtain
data. Your program will use all of the information you’ve learned in the class in order to create a useful
application.

Your program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from
OpenWeatherMap. Your program must display the weather information in a READABLE format to the user.

1. Create a header for your program just as you have in the past.
2. Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
3. Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
4. Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
5. Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.
6. Use functions including a main function.
7. Allow the user to run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for
multiple locations.
8. Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isn’t presented notify the user.
9. Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
a. Use Try blocks to ensure that your request was successful. If the connection was not successful
display a message to the user.
10. Use Python 3
11. Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user
indicating whether or not the connection was successful
